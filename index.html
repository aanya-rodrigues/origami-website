        <h2>What is origami? </h2>
        <h3  style="background-color: blanchedalmond; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.

Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper...<a target=”_blank” href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">learn more about origami here</a> </h3>
